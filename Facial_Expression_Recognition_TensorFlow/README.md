# AnnTF.Py

<p>AnnTF.py file includes hidden layer operations.</p>

# Util.Py
<p>Util.py file includes GetImageData,GetData, ErrorRate, Weight Calculation functions. Import Util to process data.</p>

# Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow).ipynb
<p>The code includes CNN model implementation.</p>

# ShowFacialImages.ipynb
<p>The code will help you investigate the facial image data. It is not used for building CNN model.</p>
